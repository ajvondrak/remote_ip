defmodule RemoteIp do
  @moduledoc """
  A plug to overwrite the `Plug.Conn`'s `remote_ip` based on headers such as
  `X-Forwarded-For`.

  To use, add the `RemoteIp` plug to your app's plug pipeline:

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp do
    use Plug.Builder

    plug RemoteIp
  end
  ```

  There are 2 options that can be passed in:

  * `:headers` - A list of strings naming the `req_headers` to use when
    deriving the `remote_ip`. Order does not matter. Defaults to `~w[forwarded
    x-forwarded-for x-client-ip x-real-ip]`.

  * `:proxies` - A list of strings in
    [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIDR) notation specifying the IPs of
    known proxies. Defaults to `[]`.

  For example, if you know you are behind proxies in the IP block 1.2.x.x that
  use the `X-Foo`, `X-Bar`, and `X-Baz` headers, you could say

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp do
    use Plug.Builder

    plug RemoteIp, headers: ~w[x-foo x-bar x-baz], proxies: ~w[1.2.0.0/16]
  end
  ```

  Note that, due to limitations in the
  [inet_cidr](https://github.com/Cobenian/inet_cidr) library used to parse
  them, `:proxies` **must** be written in full CIDR notation, even if
  specifying just a single IP. So instead of `"127.0.0.1"` and `"a:b::c:d"`,
  you would use `"127.0.0.1/32"` and `"a:b::c:d/128"`.
