# Level integration test

This app compiles remote\_ip with debugging enabled, but sets the log level to a custom value.

```elixir
config :remote_ip, debug: true, level: :info
```

The tests ensure `RemoteIp.call/2` & `RemoteIp.from/2` log their outputs at the configured log level. We don't make any specific assertions about the message content, though. For that, we lean on the [debug](../debug) integration test.

However, the inputs are constructed in such a way that every type of `RemoteIp.Debug` message that _can_ be generated _should_ be generated by the examples. We don't actually do anything to programmatically ensure this is the case, though.
